# Heart Disease Prediction - ML
 This project leverages tabular neural networks to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on various risk factors. Utilizing the UCI Machine Learning Repository's Heart Disease dataset, this project employs data analysis and visualization techniques to identify key correlations and insights.

## Dataset
The dataset contains patient health records with features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Fasting Blood Sugar
- Resting ECG results
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved
- Exercise Induced Angina
- ST Depression (Oldpeak)
- Slope of the peak exercise ST segment
- Number of major vessels colored by fluoroscopy
- Thalassemia type
